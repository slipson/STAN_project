# STAN_project
smoke test automation network project

This project will automate the smoke tester and 
feed the results to those who need it in an aesthetic and intuitive display.
The three main components include: the database (which will not be stored here),
the backend files coded in php, and the frontend html files which also consist of javascript and css.
